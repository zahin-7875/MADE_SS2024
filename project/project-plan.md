## Title

Impact of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the Extent of Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Main Question

How do greenhouse gas emissions correlate with changes in sea ice extent over time?

This question seeks to understand the relationship between the levels of various greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and the observable changes in the extent of sea ice. By exploring this correlation, we can gain insights into the direct impacts of human-induced emissions on polar ice caps, which are crucial indicators of climate change. This understanding can inform climate policy and help predict future changes in sea ice extent under different emission scenarios.

## Description

This project will look at how global greenhouse gas emissions affect the amount of sea ice. We'll combine data on greenhouse gas emissions and sea ice extent to see if more emissions lead to less sea ice. We'll use statistical and time series methods to study trends in emissions like CO2, CH4, and N2O and how they relate to changes in sea ice over the past few decades. By understanding this relationship, the project will provide insights into how climate change impacts the polar regions, which is important for understanding global climate dynamics and developing strategies to reduce these effects.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: International Greenhouse Gas Emissions

- Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions
- Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions?select=greenhouse_gas_inventory_data_data.csv
- Data Type: CSV

This dataset covers global greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2014. It includes data on different greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4, and N2O. The emissions come from various sources such as industry, transportation, and agriculture. This information helps us understand how emissions have changed over time and identify the main sources of these gases.

### Datasource2: Daily Sea Ice Extent Data

- Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data
- Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data?select=seaice.csv
- Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains daily records of sea ice extent from 1978 to 2015. It includes information like the year, month, day, ice extent, any missing data, the data source, and whether it's from the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. This detailed data will help us analyze how sea ice extent has changed over time and compare these changes with trends in greenhouse gas emissions.
